                The name that I have chosen for my site will be called "Fiore Chamber of Commerce." To help me get my thought process in order, but also show creativity, I have chosen a fictional location based on a show that I enjoyed.

                The purpose of Fiore Chamber of Commerce is to serve our members as an advocate to create a successful business climate that will advance the wizards and guilds throughout the whole Fiore lands.
                <br>1. For the Guilds: We will strive to provide dependable communication and information, ensuring that your wizards stay informed about the latest developments in the economic, educational, cultural, and civic aspects of the Fiore community. We offer special services/assistance with marketing, HR, accounting and security. 
                <br>2. For the wizards in the Guilds: You will have access to discounts provided by member guilds as well as the ability to negotiate your own deals. 
                <br>3. For All: There will be more potential for Guild exposure and recognition. As we foster greater engagement and participation through volunteer and charity events, your Guild will have increased collaborations, partnerships, and increased support from various wizards.
