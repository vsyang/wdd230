                The name that I have chosen for my site will be called "Fiore Chamber of Commerce." To help me get my thought process in order, but also show creativity, I have chosen a fictional location based on a show that I enjoyed.

            <p>
                I had the pleasure to play with some color combinations on <a href="https://coolors.com">coolors.com</a> and decided on this combination:
            </p>

                <div class="color-name">Payne's Gray: Heading Font</div><div class="color-example heading-font">495867</div>

                Typography
            </h2>
            <p>
                Utilizing <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a>, I have chosen to use Merriweather, Lato, and Roboto. Here's an idea of where I may use these fonts:                 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heading 1-4: Merriweather</li>
                <li>Body Font: Lato</li>
                <li>In case I need more font: Roboto</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                Selected Google Font Used
            </h2>
            <p>
                Here is a sample of how I would like to portray the fonts throughout this project:                 
            </p>
            <div class="font-usage">
                <h2>
                    Heading font (h1, h2) using Merriweather.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lato font for everything else.
                </p>
                <p class="extra-font">
                    Roboto font will be my backup in case Lato font doesn't work.
